<h2 id="sec-1">1 Abstract </h2>
<div id="text-1">


<p>
This note describes an LED blinking program written in assembly
language for the LPC17xx family of ARM Cortex M3 chips.  As written,
it runs on the LPCXpresso LPC1769 board (where the LED is on Port 0,
bit 22).  To run on other LPC17xx boards where an LED is on a
different port pin, either adjust this code to use a different port
pin or else use a logic probe on Port 0, bit 22, as a temporary LED,
and run the program as-is.
</p>
<p>
It shows the commands for assembling and linking with the GNU
assembler and linker and also the commands for burning the program
into the board's flash memory via a JTAG connector and the OpenOCD
software or with the lpc21isp serial bootloader (flash) utility.
</p>
<p>
The binary file is also included in case you would like to jump right
to burning it into flash.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">2 The hardware </h2>
<div id="text-2">


<p>
I used the LPCXpresso LPC1769 board.  I do not recommend the
LPCXpresso boards and suggest you get a different LPC17xx board
instead.
</p>
<p>
On the LPCXpresso board, an LED is connected to bit 22 of Port 0.
This is labeled "LED2".  It is near J6-36.  When Port 0 bit 22 is
high, the LED lights up.
</p>
<p>
Below, I describe some hardware modifications (basically soldering
some headers for easy access and adding a serial adapter) .  You may
not need to do even this much if
</p>
<ul>
<li>
you use an LPCXpresso board but can burn the flash successfully
from the Code Red IDE

</li>
<li>
you use an LPCXpresso board in some sort of a base board that
supplies a serial adapter and/or a JTAG connector

</li>
<li>
you use a different LPC17xx board with a JTAG adapter or a serial
port adapter

</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.1">2.1 Add Headers </h3>
<div id="text-2.1">


<p>
I cut the traces on the bottom of the board between the LPC-Link part
of the board and the LPC1769 part of the board.  Then, I soldered a
16-pin header (2x8, double row, 8 pins in each row) and shorted pins 1
and 2 together (3.3V) and shorted pins 15 and 16 together (ground)
(or, just don't cut those two traces).  Pins 1, 2, 15, and 16 provide
a convenient place to pick up power and ground for the serial adapter.
This header is labeled J4 on the board.
</p>
<p>
I also soldered a single-row 27-pin header on each edge of the LPC1769
side of the board to give easy access to the serial port pins and
other pins.  This header is labeled J6 on the board.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-2.2">2.2 Serial port </h3>
<div id="text-2.2">


<p>
In order to use the chip's built-in serial bootloader, I wired a
serial adapter to UART0 so I could program the flash with the lpc21isp
flash utility.  You can get such an adapter from SparkFun
(<a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">http://www.sparkfun.com/</a>).  I built my own with two gates of a 4049
chip (a real 4049, not a 74HC4049, because we need it to run at 3.3
volts) and some resistors.

<h2 id="sec-3">3 The software tools </h2>
<div id="text-3">


<p>
I did not use the Code Red IDE.  I tried it briefly but I did not get
along well with it.  Because of this, I cannot recommend the
LPCXpresso boards.
</p>
<p>
The software described here, needed to preprocess, assemble, link, and
burn the demo program into the ARM Cortex board, runs on Linux.  If
you do not have Linux available, it can be as simple as temporarily
booting an Ubuntu live CD (see details at
<a href="http://pygmy.utoh.org/riscy/">http://pygmy.utoh.org/riscy/</a>) and installing the "Bundle of Tools".
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.1">3.1 The assembler and linker </h3>
<div id="text-3.1">


<p>
We use (parts of) the GNU toolchain, running on Linux (such as Ubuntu
10.04).  In particular we need the GNU "binutils" package, which
includes the ARM assembler and linker and some utilities to manipulate
the output files.  We do not need the C or C++ compiler.
</p>
<p>
This is a <b>cross assembler</b>.  It runs on a PC (such as a typical
desktop or laptop with an Intel CPU) but produces code for an ARM CPU.
</p>
<p>
If you don't have GNU binutils for the ARM installed, you can download
my "Bundle of Tools" at <a href="http://pygmy.utoh.org/riscy/">http://pygmy.utoh.org/riscy/</a>.

<div id="outline-container-3.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.2">3.2 The preprocessor </h3>
<div id="text-3.2">


<p>
The GNU ARM assembler prefers to use the at-sign for comments.  I
prefer to use the semicolon for comments.  So, I write the assembly
language program using semicolons for comments then run the program
through a preprocessor that converts semicolons to at-signs before
feeding the program to the ARM assembler.
</p>
<p>
The preprocessor program is named <code>preasm.tcl</code> and is included in the
tools bundle mentioned in the previous section.  If you prefer, you
can manually convert the semicolons to at-signs.

<h3 id="sec-4.2">4.2 Notes about the source code </h3>
<div id="text-4.2">


<p>
The goal for this program (other than blinking the LED) is to start
with a <b>very simple</b> program.  This lets us check out our toolchain,
our flash utility and/or JTAG connector and software, and our mental
model of how it all works without getting bogged down in unnecessary
complexities.  For example, we do not use subroutines.  We only set up
the hardware stack because the ARM Cortex loads the stack pointer
automatically.  We hard-code the output port configuration register
(rather than setting just the bits we need for the LED pin).  We do
not alter the clock source or speed (we use the default internal 4 MHz
clock).  We just want something to run <b>now</b> !
</p>
<p>
The LPC1769 MCU uses the "Thumb-2" instruction set, not the "ARM"
instruction set.  Even though the <code>.thumb</code> directive is equivalent to
the <code>.code 16</code> directive, the processor is still a 32-bit processor.
</p>
<p>
We define some symbolic constants, including the initial stack value
(<code>STACKINIT</code>) and the LED delay value (<code>LEDDELAY</code>).  If, after getting
the program to run, you would prefer to make the LED blink faster or
slower, then change the value of <code>LEDDELAY</code>.
</p>
<p>
The program starts at address zero (0x0000 0000) with the vector
table.  Each vector table slot is 4 bytes long.  The first entry is
the initial value for the stack pointer.  We use 0x1000 4000 for the
initial stack value.
</p>
<p>
The second slot in the vector table holds the address where program
execution will begin.  In this case, it is at the label <code>_start</code>.
Actually, we adjust the address slightly in the vector table by adding
1 to it to make it odd.  This is required because, in Thumb mode, a
value loaded into the program counter must have its least significant
bit set.  I suppose there is a way to avoid doing this by putting the
vectors is a special section and giving the linker certain command
options and/or using an assembler directive. 
</p>
<p>
We fill in several more slots in the vector table for various
exceptions.  They all point to a loop at the end of the program.  We
do not expect any of these exceptions to be triggered, but if they
are, the program will just hang in a loop, incrementing two registers
(so we will have something to look at if we are tracing the program in
a debugger).
</p>
<p>
The rest of the logic should be straightforward.  We alternately write
a "1" bit to the FIOCLR and the FIOSET registers to turn bit 22 of
Port 0 on and off (to turn the LED off and on), killing time so the
LED flashes at exactly the speed we like best (adjust <code>LEDDELAY</code> to
your personal taste).

<h2 id="sec-5">5 Assembling and linking </h2>
<div id="text-5">


<p>
Assuming you have the assembler and linker and other tools installed
where I install them, here are the commands to preprocess, assemble,
link, and build a binary:
</p>
<pre class="example">
$ /usr/local/bin/preasm.tcl led-lpc17xx.asm led-lpc17xx.s 
$ /usr/local/arm/bin/arm-elf-as -mcpu=cortex-m3 -mthumb -mapcs-32 -gstabs -ahls=led-lpc17xx.lst -o led-lpc17xx.o led-lpc17xx.s
$ /usr/local/arm/bin/arm-elf-ld -v -T lpc17xx.ld -nostartfiles -o led-lpc17xx.elf led-lpc17xx.o
$ /usr/local/arm/bin/arm-elf-objcopy -O binary led-lpc17xx.elf  led-lpc17xx.bin
</pre>

<p>
The goal is to produce the file <code>led-lpc17xx.bin</code> to burn into the
MCU's flash memory.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">6 Burning the flash with a JTAG connector </h2>
<div id="text-6">


<p>
(I used the serial bootloader instead.  See the next section.)
</p>
<p>
You can use any method you prefer to burn <code>led-lpc17xx.bin</code> into the
flash.  Here is how I might do it if I had a working JTAG connection
to the LPCXpresso board, using OpenOCD and the Olimex ARM USB Tiny
JTAG adaptor (<a href="http://olimex.com/dev/arm-usb-tiny.html">http://olimex.com/dev/arm-usb-tiny.html</a>):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Open a terminal and start the OpenOCD daemon with
<pre class="example">
$ openocd -f openocdlpc17xx.cfg
</pre>

</li>
<li>
In another terminal, connect to the daemon with
<pre class="example">
$ telnet localhost 4444
</pre>

</li>
<li>
Then in the telnet terminal, type the following commands (not all
are necessary)

<pre class="example">
&gt; help
  run above to see all OpenOCD commands
&gt; halt
&gt; poll
&gt; flash erase_sector 0 0 0

  hopefully this shows we erased sector 0 successfully
&gt; flash write_bank 0 led-lpc17xx.bin 0

  above displays the 7 vector slots as 32-bit words, note all slots except
  the first have the least significant bit set
&gt; mdb 0 28
  above displays the 7 vector slots as 28 bytes (note, little endian)

  above disassembles the program starting at the label "_start"
&gt; reset init

</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">7 Burning the flash through the serial bootloader </h2>
<div id="text-7">


<p>
I used a serial connection on the PC (on <code>/dev/ttyS1</code> in my case),
along with the lpc21isp flash utility, to program the flash with this
command: 
</p>
<pre class="example">
lpc21isp  -donotstart -verify -bin led-lpc17xx.bin  /dev/ttyS1 38400 4000
</pre>

<p>
I used a serial adapter to convert the LPC1769 chip's UART0 TTL-level
signals to RS232-level signals (or close enough).  I made the adapter
with a 4049 hex inverter chip, using one gate for Rx and one gate for
Tx with a resistor on the inputs to provide a little current-limiting
protection.  I picked up power and ground from J4-2 and J4-16.  I
picked up Tx and Rx from J6-22 and J6-21.
</p>
<p>
I also set up two jumper wires:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
one on J6-4 (nRESET)

<p>
The chip can be reset by briefly touching the other end of this
jumper to J6-1 (ground), eliminating the need to unplug and replug
the USB connector in order to reset the board
</p>
</li>
<li>
one on J6-51 (Port 2, bit 10)

<p>
If this pin is low when the chip comes out of reset, the chip goes
into serial bootloader mode.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The sequence to program the flash is this
</p>
<ul>
<li>
jump J6-51 (bootloader) to J6-54 (ground)

</li>
<li>
type in the lpc21isp command 

</li>
<li>
briefly touch the jumper from J6-4 (nRESET) to J6-1 (ground) to
reset the chip

</li>
<li>
see that lpc21isp runs successfully (do we need to ignore the
verify failure message?  See the "Dead end" section below.)

</li>
<li>
remove the jumper from J6-51

</li>
<li>
again briefly touch the jumper from J6-4 to J6-1 to reboot the chip
in non-bootloader mode

</li>
<li>
watch the LED blink

</ul>

<div id="text-10.1">


<p>
Although I found the "Program Flash" tool bar button, and could make
it apparently go through the steps to burn led-lpc17xx.bin, it didn't
seem to work.  (Of course, if you try this after you cut the traces
between the LPC-Link side and the LPC1769 side, you need to jumper
them again.  For example, solder a 2x8 header into J4 then use
shorting blocks on all 8 pairs).
</p>
<p>
If you should get this working, and especially if you are then able to
tell Code Red that led-lpc17xx.s is the source code file, and are then
able to step through it in the Code Red debugger, please email me with
full details as to how you did it.

<div id="text-10.2">


<p>
After cutting the traces and installing the 2x8 header for J4, and
soldering in the 2x27 header (well, two separate 1x17 headers) for J6,
I wired up an adapter to the board for my Olimex USB-TINY JTAG adapter
and tried working with it with OpenOCD.
</p>
<p>
I did succeed in dumping memory, but attempting to program the flash
and/or to single step failed.

Here is how I wired my connector, showing where I picked up the JTAG
signals.

<p>
I didn't bother with any pull-ups or pull-downs, assuming the signals
that needed that were already pulled up or down on the LPCXpresso
board itself.  That I was able to communicate through this adapter
(the mdw command to dump memory) seems to support this assumption.
</p>
<p>
I understand the RTCK signal is not needed.  I really wanted to
connect the NTRST signal, which apparently comes from the LPC1769
chip's pin 100, but I could not find where the LPCXpresso board
brought that signal out to any connector and I did not want to try
soldering to the tiny pins of the LPC1769 chip.
</p>
<p>
If you find that NTRST/pin 100 is in fact accessible somewhere on the
board, please tell me where.
</p>
<p>
If you are able to get "real" JTAG (as opposed to the proprietary Code
Red version) working with this board, please tell me how you did it.

<h3 id="sec-10.3">10.3 Verify error with lpc21isp version 1.79 </h3>
<div id="text-10.3">


<p>
This is not necessarily a dead end.  I did successfully program the
flash so that the LED blinking program would run.  I used this command
</p>
<pre class="example">
lpc21isp  -donotstart -verify -bin led-lpc17xx.bin  /dev/ttyS1 38400 4000
</pre>

<p>
and it reported a verification failure.  What I would like to know is
whether the my particular LPC1769 chip does indeed have some bad flash
(but not in places that would prevent the LED blinking program from
running) or if the lpc21isp program (version 1.79) is failing to
verify flash that in fact is programmed successfully.
</p>
<p>
An obvious experiment, which I have not tried yet, is to slow down the
baudrate, using somethink like
</p>
<pre class="example">
lpc21isp  -donotstart -verify -bin led-lpc17xx.bin  /dev/ttyS1 1200 4000
</pre>

<p>
So, if you use lpc21isp to program the flash in an LPCXpresso board,
please email me to tell me how it worked for you.
